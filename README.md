# Changes in Intrinsic Excitability of Hippocampal Pyramidal Cells in Parkinson's Disease Model: A Promising Target

## Research Overview

This study investigated changes in intrinsic excitability of hippocampal pyramidal cells using a Parkinson's Disease (PD) model. The research focused on analyzing spike train characteristics and action potential features to understand how PD affects neuronal firing patterns and membrane properties.

## What I Did

### Data Collection and Processing
- Collected electrophysiological data from hippocampal pyramidal cells in two groups: intact (control) and PD model
- Processed raw voltage and current recordings from multiple neurons (N1-N10 for intact, N1-N8 for PD)
- Implemented automated spike detection and feature extraction algorithms

### Spike Analysis Pipeline
- Developed a custom Python class (`Data_Class`) for automated data processing
- Extracted spike trains from continuous voltage recordings
- Identified individual action potentials and calculated key electrophysiological parameters
- Analyzed both first and subsequent spikes in each recording

### Feature Extraction
- Measured 10 key electrophysiological parameters for each spike:
  - **Voltage parameters**: peak voltage, threshold, minimum afterhyperpolarization (minAHP), amplitude
  - **Temporal parameters**: time-to-peak (TTP-peak), time-to-AHP (TTP-AHP), spike width, first spike latency
  - **Additional metrics**: interspike intervals (ISI) for sequential spikes

## What I Found

### Key Differences Between PD and Intact Groups

**First Spike Characteristics:**
- PD neurons showed altered first spike latency compared to intact controls
- Significant differences in threshold voltage and spike amplitude
- Modified time-to-peak and time-to-AHP parameters

**Spike Train Properties:**
- PD neurons exhibited changes in spike frequency adaptation
- Altered interspike intervals between consecutive action potentials
- Modified spike width and afterhyperpolarization characteristics

**Group-Level Patterns:**
- Consistent differences across multiple neurons in each group
- Distinct electrophysiological signatures between PD and intact conditions
- Changes suggesting altered intrinsic excitability in the PD model

## Significance

This research provides quantitative evidence of altered intrinsic excitability in hippocampal pyramidal cells under PD conditions. The findings suggest that changes in membrane properties and spike generation mechanisms may contribute to cognitive deficits associated with Parkinson's disease, identifying potential therapeutic targets for intervention.
